Create patterns and modify them in real time, or let Xynthesizr do it for you using its **morphing algorithms**. Change **scale** and **key**, or **transpose** within a scale on-the-fly. Tweak parameters of the **internal synthesizer** or output **MIDI** to your favorite apps and devices. Record and share your creations.
