**Velvet Machine** is an audio effect based on real-time convolution with enveloped velvet noise. Here is what it can do:
- Stretch and blur out even short sounds to lengths of up to 10 seconds
- Produce reverb-like textures with flexible volume envelope (including reverse, fading in and out, pulsating etc.)
- Work as a variable density random multi-tap delay (bordering on granular-like sounds)

> **Note:** Velvet Machine is a CPU-intensive effect. A *minimum* of 5th Gen iPad, iPhone 6s or 1st Gen iPhone SE is required to run a single instance at maximum settings. With shorter times and/or lower densities CPU use is proportionally lower, but can still be relatively high.

Velvet Machine includes a functional standalone app, however it's mainly intended to be used as an AUv3 plugin app extension in a host app such as GarageBand, AUM, Cubasis and others. It does not support the now deprecated Inter-App Audio.
