## User Reviews

**Fantastic update!** ★★★★★
Along with the multiple other new or improved features, the addition of MIDI has made this a must have app! The very powerful and inspiring random/generative engine is paired with a surprisingly well specified synthesizer and provide far too much fun for the price!

**Must have for iOS music** ★★★★★
Absolutely awesome app that just got better. Create stunning sequences. Great presets to start with. Midi to favorite synths for more sounds. Just get it.

**Amazing** ★★★★★
This is now my go to software for starting a new track. I use it to build a few melodies, and then use that as a base for my new track. Love it. Great job

**Brilliant** ★★★★★
The update is brilliant! Thank you so much. This is beyond dreamy! Wonderful! :-). I am so happy MIDI has been included. Synchronicity...here we come. Cheers!
